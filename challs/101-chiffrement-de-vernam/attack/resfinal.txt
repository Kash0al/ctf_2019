Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll

is a Colombian singer-songwriter, dancer, record producer, choreographer,
and model. Born and raised in Barranquilla, she began performing in
school, demonstrating Latin, Arabic, and rock and roll influences and
belly dancing abilities. Shakira released her first studio albums, Magia
and Peligro, in the early 1990s, failing to attain commercial success;
however, she rose to prominence in Latin America with her major-label
debut, Pies Descalzos (1996), and her fourth album, Donde Estan los
Ladrones (1998).

Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry
Service (2001). Its lead single, "Whenever, Wherever", became the
best-selling single of 2002. Her success was solidified with her sixth
and seventh albums Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1 and Oral Fixation, Vol. 2
(2005), the latter of which spawned the best-selling song of the 21st
century, "Hips Don't Lie". Shakira's eighth and ninth albums, She Wolf
(2009) and Sale el Sol (2010), received critical praise but suffered from
limited promotion due to her strained relationship with label Epic
Records. Her official song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, "Waka Waka (This
Time for Africa)", became the biggest-selling World Cup song of all time.
With over 720 million views, its music video is the seventh most-watched
video on YouTube. Since 2013, Shakira has served as a coach on the
American version of The Voice, having appeared in two of its six seasons
(4.and 6). Her tenth album c°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

A university (Latin: "universitas", "a whole") is an institution of
higher education and research which grants academic degrees in a variety
of subjects and provides both undergraduate education and postgraduate
education. The word "university" is derived from the Latin universitas
magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means "community of teachers and
scholars."

The original Latin word "universitas" refers in general to "a number of
persons associated into one body, a society, company, community, guild,
corporation, etc." At the time of the emergence of urban town life and
medieval guilds, specialised "associations of students and teachers with
collective legal rights usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes,
prelates, or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated
by this general term. Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and
determined the qualifications of their members.

The Moon (Latin: Luna) is the Earth's only natural satellite.
Although not the largest natural satellite in the Solar System, it is,
among the satellites of major planets, the largest relative to the size
of the object it orbits (its primary) and, after Jupiter's
satellite Io, it is the second most dense satellite among those whose
densities are known.

The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same
face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between
the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. It
is the most luminous object in the sky after the Sun. Although it appears
a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance
just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky
and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon
an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and
mythology. The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides
and the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital
distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have
an apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun. This
allows the Moon to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse.
This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon's linear
distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 +- 0.07 cm
per year, but this rate is not constant.

Cyclura nubila, also known as the Cuban iguana, is a species of lizard of
the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas, one
of the most endangered groups of lizards. This herbivorous species with
red eyes, a thick tail, and spiked jowls is one of the largest lizards in
the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the rocky
southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a
feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found
on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate
subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites
excavated by Cuban crocodiles. As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana
often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti. Although the wild
population is in decline because of predation by feral animals and
habitat loss caused by human agricultural development, its numbers have
been bolstered as a result of captive-breeding and other conservation
programs. Cyclura nubila has been used to study evolution and animal
communication, and its captive-breeding program has been a model for
other endangered lizards in the Caribbean.

Republique francaise

is a sovereign country in Western Europe that includes several overseas
regions and territories. Metropolitan France extends from the
Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the
Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of only three countries (with
Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.
Due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as l'Hexagone ("The
Hexagon").

By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest
country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the third-largest
in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the
20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the
EU. France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in
Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial
center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4
October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its
sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the
world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during
the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.

Placement new operator:

Line 1 creates an array of sizeof(Fred) bytes of memory, which is big
enough to hold a Fred object. Line 2 creates a pointer place that points
to the first byte of this memory (experienced C programmers will note
that this step was unnecessary, it's there only to make the code more
obvious). Line 3 essentially just calls the constructor Fred::Fred().
The this pointer in the Fred constructor will be equal to place. The
returned pointer f will therefore be equal to place.

ADVICE: Don't use this placement new syntax unless you have to. Use it
only when you really care that an object is placed at a particular
location in memory. For example, when your hardware has a memory-mapped
IO timer device, and you want to place a Clock object at that memory
location.

DANGER: You are taking sole responsibility that the pointer you pass to
the placement new operator points to a region of memory that is big
enough and is properly aligned for the object type that you're creating.
Neither the compiler nor the run-time system make any attempt to check
whether you did this right. If your Fred class needs to be aligned on a 4
byte boundary but you supplied a location that isn't properly aligned,
you can have a serious disaster on your hands (if you don't know what
alignment means, please don't use the placement new syntax). You have
been warned.

You are also solely responsible for destructing the placed object. This
is done by explicitly calling the destructor:

A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry
out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a
sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve
more than one kind of problem.

Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element,
typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The
processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a
sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in
response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to
be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved
and retrieved.

In World War II, mechanical analog computers were used for specialized
military applications. During this time the first electronic digital
computers were developed. Originally they were the size of a large room,
consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers
(PCs).

Courage

Courage is the ability and willingness to confront fear, pain, danger,
uncertainty, or intimidation. Physical courage is courage in the face of
physical pain, hardship, death, or threat of death, while moral courage
is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame,
scandal, or discouragement.

In some traditions, fortitude holds approximately the same meaning as
courage. In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come
from philosophers such as Aristotle, Aquinas and Kierkegaard; in the
Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the Tao Te
Ching. More recently, courage has been explored by the discipline of
psychology.
